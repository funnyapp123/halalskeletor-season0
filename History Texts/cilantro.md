# Cilantro History

This was a world between Matthew, Ben, and Jacob. The spawn region was just a tundra with a village nearby, which is where Ben set up his base (which was made out of a naturally spawned igloo). Matt decided to set out thousands of blocks, which proved to make the server experience less fun because it was almost like playing a single player world. Eventually, a nether highway was started to bridge Matt and Ben's house together. Jacob joined the server around this point and built his house around Ben's, further making Matt realize "Oh fuck, I'm a dumbus for moving my house that far out." Jacob specialized in making a bee farm and a villager outpost (although they all seem to be gone from the world download). Ben made cows and a skeleton farm. What did Matt make? Well, he started a sheep farm and dyed one yellow, named it Geoff, then started making a cathedral for him to live in. Priorities were straight. Matt also autofished like fucking hell, leading to him getting all of his mending and all the food he could want with ease, which led to the server feeling even *less* fun for him. Eventually, Jacob was geared up for The End while Matt and Ben stopped playing, concluding the story for the Cilantro section.

#The Hub

So, with great Spigot World Splitting comes a great need for a spawn hub so people can get into their world. The Hub is near and dear to my (matt) special little shrivled heart because it was the very first thing I did for the server. Me and Ben decided on the server name of Halal Skeletor and I got to making a hub that made that name have weight. It was a mosque map I downloaded, terraformed, world bordered, and to top it all off, imported a picture of the Halal Skeletor with a Windows XP header to be converted into block art. This was by far the coolest part of the server to me, which is kind of sad. However, there was one major issue: once you went into a world, there was no reason to leave. The hub had nothing captivating, so it was only just the spawn location for players until they went into their world. There were only 4 spawn portals ever made here, which were The Boys, Cilantro, Creative Normal, and Creative Superflat.

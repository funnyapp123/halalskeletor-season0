# Season 0

These are the Spigot Servers

These are to be opened in 1.15.2

No player data was recorded (everyone spawns at world spawn, no inventory, no e chest, etc)

No player reached The End.

There are individual releases for 
- Just "The Boys" world
- Just "Cilantro" world
- Both "The Boys" and "Cilantro" world files
- the hub world
- the creative worlds
- all of the worlds

Just a bit of history (More individual history in the respectively named MD files):

  So it was the olden days and I wanted to make a server. I decided to split my 2 friend groups because I have a really really smooth brain (hence why there are 2 world files). We were all working out fine, but the playtime dwindled due to nobody playing together because split groups. Eventually, 1.16 came out and the world file would corrupt if I tried to update, so we were stuck in 1.15.2, which was the real end of the server. Eventually, I ended the Spigot run after a couple months and revamped Halal Skeletor into vanilla.


The worlds are defaulted to:
- Normal Difficulty
- Adventure Gamemode
- keepInventory false
- doDaylightCycle true
- doWeatherCycle true
- Cheats off

(if you want to change theses just open the world to LAN with cheats enabled)
